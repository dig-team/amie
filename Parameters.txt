Command line parameters documentation

Basic command: 
java -jar amie3.jar [TSV file]

Parameters:

#  -mins <number>
   Minimum absolute support. The number of positive examples.
   Default value: 100 

#  -minc <number>
   Minimum size of the relations to be considered as head relations. The number of  facts or entities depending on the bias.
   Default value: 100 

#  -minhc <number>
   Minimum head coverage. 
   Default value: 0.01

#  -oute <number>
   Print the rules at the end and not while they are discovered.
   Default: False
   
#  -pm <support/headcoverage>
   Metric used for pruning of intermediate queries: support|headcoverage.
   Default value: headcoverage


#  -datalog
   Print rules using the datalog notation.
   Default: False

#  -bexr <relations>
   Do not use these relations as atoms in the body of rules.
   Example: java -jar amie3.jar -bexr bornIn

#  -hexr <relations>
   Do not use these relations as atoms in the head of rules. (Incompatible with head-target-relations)
   Example: java -jar amie3.jar -hexr bornIn

#  -iexr <relations>
   Do not instantiate these relations. Should be used with -fconst or -const. (incompatible with instantiation-target-relations). 
   Example: java -jar amie3.jar -iexr bornIn

#  -htr <relations>
   Mine only rules with these relations in the head. Provide a list of relation names separated by commas. (incompatible with head-excluded-relations)
   Example: java -jar amie3.jar -htr bornIn

#  -btr <relations>
   Allow only these relations in the body. Provide a list of relation names separated by commas (incompatible with body-excluded-relations)
   Example: java -jar amie3.jar -btr bornIn

#  -itr <relations>
   Allow only these relations to be instantiated. Should be used with -fconst or -const. Provide a list of relation names separated by commas(incompatible with instantiation-excluded-relations).
   Example: java -jar amie3.jar -itr bornIn

#  -maxad <number>
   Maximum number of atoms in the antecedent and succedent of rules.
   Default value: 3

#  -minpca <number>
   Minimum PCA confidence threshold.This value is not used for pruning, only for filtering of the results.
   Defalut value: 0.0

!!!   #  -const
         Enable rules with constants. 
         Default value: false

!!!   #  -fconst
         Enforce constants in all atoms. 
         Default: false

#  -bias
   Syntatic/semantic bias: oneVar|default|lazy|lazit|[Path to a subclass of amie.mining.assistant.MiningAssistant]
   Default: default (defines support and confidence in terms of 2 head variables given an order, cf -vo)

#  -caos
   If a single variable bias is used (oneVar),force to count support always on the subject position.

#  -nc
   Preferred number of cores. Round down to the actual number of cores in the system if a higher value is provided

#  -minc <number>
   Minimum standard confidence threshold. This value is not used for pruning, only for filtering of the results. 
   Default: 0.0.

#  -optimcb
   Enable the calculation of confidence upper bounds to prune rules.

#  -optimfh
   Enable functionality heuristic to identify potential low confident rules for pruning.

???   #  -verbose
         Maximal verbosity.

???   #  -rl
      Recursivity limit

#  -auta
   Avoid unbound type atoms, e.g., type(x, y), i.e., bind always 'y' to a type.

#  -deml
   Do not exploit max length for speedup(requested by the reviewers of AMIE+). 
   Defalut value: False

#  -dqrw
   Disable query rewriting and caching.

#  -dpr
   Disable perfect rules.

#  -oout
   If enabled, it activates only the output enhacements, that is, the confidence approximation and upper bounds. It overrides any other configuration that is incompatible.

#  -full
   It enables all enhancements: lossless heuristics and confidence approximation and upper bounds. It overrides any other configuration that is incompatible.

#  -noHeuristics
   Disable functionality heuristic, should be used with the -full option.

#  -noKbRewrite
   Prevent the KB to rewrite query when counting pairs.

#  -noKbExistsDetection 
   Prevent the KB to detect existential variable on-the-fly and to optimize the query.

#  -noSkyline
   Disable Skyline pruning of results.

#  -vo
   Define the order of the variable in counting query among: app, fun (default), ifun.

#  -ef
   An additional text file whose interpretation depends on the selected mining assistant (bias).

#  -ostd
   Do not calculate standard confidence.

#  -cc
   Cache count results.

#  -optimai
   Prune instantiated rules that decrease too much the support of their parent rule (ratio 0.2).

#  -mlg
   Parse labels language as new facts

#  -d <>
   Separator in input files. 
   Default separator: TAB
